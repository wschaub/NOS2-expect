===== Stage 0 ===== (Github repo with original tapes and all our mods/scripts/documentation but no generated artifacts) 
1. We start with modsets split out into files in a github repo plus some skeleton batch decks, expect scripts etc.
2. use a script to generate batch decks from our modsets. 
3. maintain expect scripts for each stage with logic for handling what's necessary for early startup and submission and checking of
   each batch deck we submit.
4.1 pull down latest dtcyber from git repo and build it.
4.2 Launch each stage in order.
5. Review listings for sanity.
5.1 Run tests if any, hopefully we can write some kind of automated smoke test. 
6. Maintain changelog/release notes.
6.1 Update any in tree documentation if needed.
6.2 make artifacts public as a release.

===== Stage 1 ===== (Create Starter system from original materials in non Y2K date, make intermediate deadstart that can run in current year)
 1. Sysgen basic system from unconfigured original deadstart tape cy871b.tap and original untouched PF tapes. 
 2. load OPL871
 3. load in y2k.tap + apply Y2K and 6DI patches and deadstart decks to tmp.tap as intermediate step (via card deck)
 4. save copy of printer output
 5. shutdown starter system. 
 6. go to stage 2.

===== Stage 2 ====== (Build real deadstarts with correct build dates for everything that's changed)
1. Deadstart starter system in the current date/time from tmp.tap
2. Submit batch jobs as card decks to load in our patches for NOS + product sets
3. Build NOS + Products with our new patches, Y2K replacement bins from y2k.tap etc.
3.1 Save listings from our patched builds of NOS and the various product sets for reference. 
4. Generate official unconfigured deadstart tape containing our patches. 
5. Generate configured deadstart tapes (or just one tape with a variety of deadstart decks for various configs) 
5.5 Save listing of the job to build the configured deadstart tape with a full itemize of what's on it + the libedit run output
6. (Optionally blow away starter system)
7. goto stage 3

===== Stage 3 ===== (Build The rest of our artifacts using the new deadstarts) 
1. Sysgen ready to run systems from configured deadstart tapes generated in stage 2 if desired. 
   This includdes things like CYBIS ready images with all the correct aux packs. CYBIS can be its own
   set of scripts that use our artifacts. 
1.1 Apply any configuration like MODVAL,Networking, etc.
1.2 Add any products and configs that belong to this flavor of ready to run system.
1.3 Depending on purpose of ready to run system we should probably add in anything needed to do NOS development 
    from the starter system, (PFDUMP of INSTALL perhaps?)
1.4 Create PFDUMP tapes of configured ready to run systems.
2. Publish our new unconfigured and configured deadstart tapes.
2.1 Publish ready to run systems. 
2.2 Publish bare cyber.ini, configured deadstart + PFDUMP versions of ready to run systems as an alternative way to bring one up. (it's much more compact this way)
3. Keep one of the pre-built systems around for day to day NOS development, export any new modsets back out to git repo.
4. Generate and publish COMPASS and DOCMENT listings of critical parts of the system like NOSTEXT from the patched version of our sources.
4.1 Export and publish CODING, SRB and other useful documents that come with NOS. 
4.2 Same for 3rd party product tapes with documentation on them.
