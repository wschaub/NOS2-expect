Hi Jack,
 
[PRIVATE MESSAGE REMOVED]
 
I am writing today to ask if you could help to free up historical CDC material
such as manuals and software so that hobbyists and researchers could freely
exchange this material and for museums such as the Computer History Museum
and the Charles Babbage Institute to make this material available online.
 
I am not asking for any material from BT Federal, but for a permission for
museums, hobbyists and researches to publish and use CDC material already in
their possession.
 
Any use would be strictly non-commercial.
 
In 2003 Syntegraâ€™s CEO Tim Smart already granted a limited concession to
myself and a small group of enthusiasts to share and use this material.
This concession does not allow the publishing of any CDC material to outside
parties.
 
All of this obsolete CDC material has been freely available for decades in
university libraries, private collections and more recently on EBay and as
scanned copies from various websites.
 
Could you please let me know if you can help with this matter or alternatively
direct me to someone within BT Federal (or BT) who could help?
 
Thanks and best regards
 
Tom Hunter
