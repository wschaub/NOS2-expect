# NOS2-expect
expect scripts for building NOS 2.8.7 with the NCC dtcyber

This repo contains a Tcl library for writing expect scripts to drive dtcyber plus some example scripts and card decks for
building NOS 2.8.7 and generating a fresh set of release tapes from the original tapes located at: 
https://cdc.sjzoppi.com/doku.php?id=nos2:installation

The expect library is GPL3, but NOS belongs to BT Federal: https://cdc.sjzoppi.com/doku.php?id=b_t_permit

The NOS modsets belong to their respective authors. 

Modsets that I haven't written were sourced from Kevin Jordan: https://github.com/kej715/DtCyber and Paul Koning's svn svn://akdesign.dyndns.org/dtcyber/trunk
